The installation of the BIBBOX software needs 3 essential steps or requirements:

- an available server that is based on Linux by default
- the installation of Docker on this server
- the installation of the BIBBOX software on this server

To provide your own server, we recommend to contact your respective IT department. Instead of the server mentioned, a virtual machine can also be set up on a normal computer, which can take over the tasks of a server.

For each of the three required requirements, here are the links to the installation instructions:

- Link: set up a virtual machine (we recommend VirtualBox) --- [VirtualBox Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Link: Installation of the docker software --- [Docker install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Link: Installation of the BIBBOX software --- [Bibbox install](https://bibbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_v4_bibbox_linux/#install-the-bibbox-in-the-beta-only-debian-based-linux-distributions-are-featured)

We recommend to read the installation guide on the official docs page.
