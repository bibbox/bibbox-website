The installation of the BIBBOX software needs 3 essential steps or requirements:
<ul>
 	<li>an available server that is based on Linux by default</li>
 	<li>the installation of Docker on this server</li>
 	<li>the installation of the BIBBOX software on this server</li>
</ul>
To provide your own server, we recommend to contact your respective IT department. Instead of the server mentioned, a virtual machine can also be set up on a normal computer, which can take over the tasks of a server.

For each of the three required requirements, here are the links to the installation instructions:
