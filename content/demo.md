## BIBBOX Playground
The website [www.demo.bibbox.org](http://www.demo.bibbox.org) is a playground that allows users to experiment with the functionalities of the BIBBOX.
This playground is a browser-supported example of the BIBBOX Portal, which can be used to test BIBBOX Apps.

Users can install and test the available Apps, and also see and use the instances installed by other users.
The Apps' instances will only be available for a short time and will be reset after a week.

## BIBBOX Demo
The website [www.fair.bibbox.org](http://www.fair.bibbox.org) is a demo instance of the BIBBOX, which already has apps pre installed.
As the demo is an example of the BIBBOX Portal, no changes can be made to the apps or the portal itself.
