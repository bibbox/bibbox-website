To give an impression of the BIBBOX, we provide a playground and a demo instance.

# BIBBOX Playground
The website [www.demo.bibbox.org](http://www.demo.bibbox.org) is a playground that allows users to experiment with the functionalities of the BIBBOX.
This playground is an example of the BIBBOX, which can be used to test BIBBOX Apps.

**Note that this is a public instance, everyone can access it, see the data and change it.**

The Apps' instances will only be available for a short time and will be reset after a week.

# BIBBOX Demo
The website [fair.bibbox.org/info](http://fair.bibbox.org/info) is a demo instance of the BIBBOX, which already has apps pre installed.
As the demo is an example of the BIBBOX Portal, no changes can be made to the apps or the portal itself.

<div style="display: flex; width:100%; justify-content: center;">
    <a href="http://fair.bibbox.org/info" target="_blank" style="color: white;">
        <button class="button signup-button rounded secondary-btn raised" style="width: unset;" >Demo Login</span>
