FAIRified Apps are BIBBOX Apps that were extended with a FAIR Data Point.
We extended three Apps with a FAIR Data Point: [Molgenis](https://www.molgenis.org/), [OpenSpecimen](https://www.openspecimen.org/), and [PhenoTips](https://phenotips.com/). We deliberately chose Apps that are used in various scientific disciplines.
Users can use demo data to test these three Apps. We provide a user management system and several demo users with different permission rights, in order to demonstrate roles such as admin, biobank user, and researcher.

[Molgenis](http://bibbox.bbmri-eric.eu/molgenis-omics-data-management/) is a web-based application for the management and analysis of scientific data.

[OpenSpecimen](http://bibbox.bbmri-eric.eu/openspecimen-sample-management/) is a biobank/biospecimen management tool.

[PhenoTips](http://bibbox.bbmri-eric.eu/phenotips-patient-registry-and-pedigrees/) is a web-based tool for medical genetics.
