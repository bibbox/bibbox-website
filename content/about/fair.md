## What is FAIR

<span style="font-weight: 400;">European guidelines recommend that scientific data should be made FAIR: <strong>findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable </strong>[1]. However, FAIR guidelines do not specify how the stated principles should be implemented, it might not be straightforward for researchers to know how to actually make their data FAIR.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIBBOX allows researchers to publish their data and the associated data management software (Apps) in a FAIR manner, through the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incorporation of a <a href="http://bibbox.bbmri-eric.eu/what-is-a-fdp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAIR Data Point</a> into the Apps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A FAIR Data Point allows exposing data and metadata in a FAIR-compliant manner.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Users can search the metadata of the published datasets and, if the licensing conditions allow, access the data itself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIBBOX is a set of tools and services that support the creation and management of FAIR Data Points. The architecture of the BIBBOX is modular and flexible, allowing researchers to add a FAIR Data Point to existing open-source software solutions and to publish these in an App Store. Hence, it helps researchers make their data FAIR.</span>

## FDP - FAIR Data Point
The FAIR Data Point exposes a resource-level description of catalogues, datasets, and distributions, in the DCAT format. This way, information about the contact person, licensing and data access procedures, is available in a standardized and machine-readable way.

The BIBBOX integrates a FAIR Data Point in each App. The FAIR data point was developed by the "FAIR Data Team" and their developed software can be found here:  <a href="https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/">FAIR Data Team</a>

The concept of FAIR Data Point [1, 2] was developed by the “FAIR Data Team” and its implementation can be found here:  <a href="https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/">FAIR Data Team.</a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, a FAIR Data Point (FDP) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers a reference implementation that allows data owners to expose the data and metadata in a FAIR manner and also allows users to discover metadata and access the data of interest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDP uses the W3C's Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) version 2 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the basis for its metadata content. DCAT enables the description of datasets and data services using a standard model and vocabulary, which facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata. </span>This way, metadata is available in a standardized and machine-readable way.

The BIBBOX allows the introduction of a FAIR Data Point in its Apps, supporting researchers in making their data FAIR.
