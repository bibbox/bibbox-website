    subtitle: We created BIBBox with a vision
    clients:
    - name: John Bradley
      quote: With BIBBox I can focus on my research and not on the infrastructure. I dont need to manage servers and can access all the tools I need in one place.
      job: Data Scientist
      img: 2
    - name: Irma Walters
      quote: The concept of FAIR Data is crucial for the future of research, as study data often has different formats, missing explanaition or is hard to get. With FAIR Data Points, we can make data more accessible and reusable.
      job: Biomedical Engineer
      img: 1
    - name: Gary Blackman
      quote: We created BIBBox on the basis of known open source frameworks. The dockerization of the tools and the use of the FAIR Data Points makes it easy to use and to extend.
